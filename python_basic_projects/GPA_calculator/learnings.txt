### üßÆ **GPA Calculator ‚Äî Learning Summary**

**Objective:**
Create a GPA calculator that accepts grades and credits for up to 7 subjects, validates all inputs, and computes the semester GPA accurately.

---

**Key Concepts Practiced:**

* **Functions & Modularity:** Split logic into `user_input()`, `calculate_gpa()`, and `main()`.
* **Loops & Conditionals:** Used nested loops with `break`/`continue` for clean validation.
* **Exception Handling:** Managed invalid inputs with `try/except ValueError`.
* **Arithmetic Logic:** Applied weighted average formula for GPA.
* **Formatting & Output:** Used f-strings and rounding for user clarity.

---

**Main Corrections Made:**

* Fixed function name (`calculate_gpa`) and adjusted `.strip()` placement.
* Set subject count range to `1‚Äì7`.
* Matched grade and credit validation logic with correct messages.
* Allowed float credits instead of integers.
* Added docstrings, blank lines, and consistent indentation (PEP 8).
* Improved user prompts for clarity and tone.

---

**Concept Reinforcements:**

* Difference between `break` vs `return` understood through debugging.
* Clearer grasp of input validation and nested loop design.
* Learned to separate computation from output (clean main function).
* Gained hands-on practice with debugger ‚Äî inspecting variable states and flow.
* Internalized PEP 8 structure: spacing, naming, and comments.

---

**Next Focus:**

* Continue using debugger to analyze logic flow.
* Next project will introduce **dictionaries (Currency Converter)**.
* Start preparing for **pytest basics** after next 1‚Äì2 projects.
* Maintain polished docstrings and consistent message tone.
