Fantastic 👏 — marking your **Bill Splitter Project (Method 2: Equal Split + Adjustment)** as **✅ Complete** is a great milestone.
Here’s your **personalized lessons learned summary**, fully based on *your code, your debugging process, and this entire chat thread* — not generic notes.

---

## 🧭 **Bill Splitter — Lessons Learned Summary**

### ✅ **1️⃣ Concept Understanding**

* Learned **two real-world split methods**:

  * *Equal split + adjustment* (used here)
  * *Proportional split by order size*
* Understood that each person’s balance = `paid − equal_share`.
* Learned how `len(contributions)` counts **dictionary keys**, not values.
* Practiced using `sum(contributions.values())` to total all numeric entries.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ Python Coding and Validation**

* Strengthened **input validation**:

  * `if not name.strip()` → detect empty names.
  * Length range checks (`2 ≤ len(name) ≤ 30`).
  * `.replace(" ", "").isalpha()` → allow only letters + spaces.
* Added **space normalization**:
  `" ".join(name.split())` → keeps one clean space between words.
* Correctly positioned `break` vs `return` inside loops.
* Avoided storing lists in a dictionary when only floats were needed
  → `persons_contributions[person] = amount` ✅
* Handled **whole-number decimal bug** with:

  ```python
  if '.' in amount_str and len(amount_str.split('.')[-1]) > 2:
      ...
  ```

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ Debugging Skills**

* Learned how to debug **TypeErrors** by checking data types (`list vs float`).
* Practiced using **print-based debugging** (`print("DEBUG:", variable)`).
* Learned to place **breakpoints** in VS Code to inspect variable states.
* Understood the difference between *function return values* and *side effects*.

---

### ✅ **4️⃣ PEP 8 & Documentation**

* Practiced proper **PEP 8 spacing, indentation, and naming**.
* Learned to write meaningful, concise **docstrings**:

  * Use **triple quotes**, imperative mood, present tense.
  * Describe **what** the function does, not how.
  * Example:

    ```python
    """Calculates how much each person owes or should receive
    based on equal share logic."""
    ```
* Corrected small wording issues (“Wecome”→“Welcome”, “Settlments”→“Settlements”).

---

### ✅ **5️⃣ Testing and pytest Mindset**

* Learned **what to test**:
  Test logic functions (`calculate_settlement`) ✅
  Avoid direct input/output functions (`get_user_input`) ❌
* Understood `assert` → checks truth; fails test if false.
* Learned `capsys.readouterr()` → captures printed output for testing.
* Internalized rule of thumb:

  > “Test what thinks, not what talks.” 💭

---

### ✅ **6️⃣ Error Handling and Edge Cases**

* Handled negative and invalid numeric inputs.
* Considered scenarios:

  * One payer only (should be settled).
  * Equal payments.
  * Zero contributor → owes full share.
  * Floating-point rounding issues.

---

### ✅ **7️⃣ Mindset Growth**

* Shifted from *just getting output* → *understanding logic + data flow*.
* Practiced reasoning before coding (“Why loop not reached?”, “Why dict not updating?”).
* Learned structured debugging > trial and error.
* Realized testing might feel slow initially but saves huge time later.

---

## 🎯 **Next Focus Area**

1. **Modularization:** Break I/O from logic (pure functions easier to test).
2. **pytest practice:** Automate tests for `calculate_settlement`.
3. **Optional next project:** Add file export (save results to `.txt` or `.csv`).
4. **Keep applying PEP 8 + docstrings habit** from first line of every new script.
