## 🧠 Learning Summary — Word/Character Counter Project

### ✅ **Concept Reinforcements (based on your questions)**

* Learned how `open()` works with `"r"` mode and what `encoding="utf-8"` does.
* Understood the purpose of `with open(...) as file:` — automatic file closing after reading.
* Understood how `split()`, `splitlines()`, and `len()` function differently:

  * `len(text)` → counts every character (including spaces, punctuation, and newlines).
  * `split()` → splits words by spaces.
  * `splitlines()` → splits text by newline (`\n`) characters to count lines.
* Clarified that `splitlines()` counts **lines**, not **sentences or paragraphs**.
* Learned to count sentences using `re.split(r'[.!?]+', text)` from the `re` (regex) module.
* Realized that commas and punctuation remain attached when using `split()` — learned to use `re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text)` for cleaner word counting.
* Practiced how to debug in **VS Code**, view variable states, and handle runtime errors.
* Understood `pytest` basics: how to call functions, use `assert`, and interpret pass/fail results.

### ⚠️ **Mistakes & Fixes**

| Mistake                                                           | Fix                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Added extra quotes around file path → `OSError`                   | Typed path without quotes or used `.strip('"')`       |
| File name misspelled (`charcter_counter`) → `ModuleNotFoundError` | Renamed correctly to `character_counter.py`           |
| Ran pytest inside REPL instead of terminal                        | Exited REPL and ran `pytest -v` in terminal           |
| Confused sentences vs lines                                       | Learned `splitlines()` counts newlines, not sentences |

### 🔧 **New Git Learnings**

* Practiced `git init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `branch`, `merge`, `delete`.
* Learned `git diff` to compare code and exit with `q`.
* Understood branch naming convention (`feature/pytest-and-docs`).
* Learned commit message standards (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` format).

---

### 🎯 **Next Focus Area**

* Practice **undo and compare commands**: `git restore`, `git reset`, `git checkout <commit_id>`.
* Use **Git tags** to mark project milestones (`git tag v1.0 -m "Stable Release"`).
* Add a **.gitignore** file to exclude cache folders (`__pycache__/`).
* Next mini-project: **File Line Counter** (builds directly on this one).
