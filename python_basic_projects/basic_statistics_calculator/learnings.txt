Here is your **personalized learning summary**, based ONLY on **your actual questions, mistakes, fixes, and reasoning** during this entire Q&A session.
(Exactly how you requested — no generic points.)

# 🧠 **What You Learned in This Project (Your Real Learnings)**

## **1. How loops actually control flow (`continue`, `break`)**

You discovered an important rule:

* `continue` only restarts **the loop it is inside**
* `break` is how you escape a loop and return control to the outer loop
* To reprompt inside a `while`, the `for loop` must end first → hence the need for a **flag**

This was a major conceptual win.

---

## **2. Using Flags to Communicate Between Loops**

You learned WHY flags exist:

* A flag is just a **variable that remembers what happened inside a loop**
* You set it inside the `for` loop
* The `while` loop checks it afterward

This helped you build correct input validation logic.

---

## **3. Correct use of `.isdigit()` and why it fails**

You learned:

* `.isdigit()` must be called as `.isdigit()` (you forgot parentheses)
* `.isdigit()` cannot detect floats or negatives
* So `try/except float()` is the correct tool

This changed your entire validation approach.

---

## **4. Sorting mistake (`numbers = numbers.sort()`)**

You discovered:

* `.sort()` modifies the list **in place** and returns **None**
* `sorted(numbers)` returns a new list

You fixed this error after debugging.

---

## **5. Integer division vs. float division**

You understood:

* `/` always gives float
* `//` gives integer (needed for list indexes)

You applied this correctly in your median logic.

---

## **6. How to compute Mode (your biggest conceptual leap)**

You mastered the logic:

1. Count occurrences using a dictionary
2. Find maximum count
3. Collect all keys matching max count
4. If max count == 1 → “no mode”

You also fixed common mistakes:

* confusing `.items()` vs `.values()`
* mixing variable names (`value` vs `values`)
* looping incorrectly

This was a major achievement.

---

## **7. Updating dictionary values**

You understood:

* `counts[num] = counts[num] + 1`
  means “replace the old value with old value + 1”
* It’s just assignment back to the same key
* Keys can be integers, not just strings

This built your understanding of dictionaries.

---

## **8. Manual min/max logic**

You learned how to find min and max **using only loops**:

```
min_value = first element
for each number:
    if number < min_value:
        update min_value
```

This strengthened your algorithmic thinking.

---

## **9. Input validation flow (your biggest design improvement)**

You now understand how to:

* split input
* trim whitespace
* skip empty entries
* catch invalid values using try/except
* use a flag to reprompt
* only return when input is fully valid

This is real-world Python skill.

---

## **10. Why you should NOT write tests yet**

You asked honestly if you should write tests now.

You learned:

* testing too early slows you down
* debugging + logic building is the priority
* you should start pytest only after the OOP phase
* you are progressing fast without tests

This was an important mindset correction.

---

# 🎉 **Your Overall Progress**

From your questions alone, you have now gained:

* Control flow mastery
* Loop logic clarity
* Dictionary-based algorithms
* Manual statistical computations
* Clean input handling
* Better PEP 8 awareness
* Proper docstrings
* Debugging confidence
* Correct numeric logic (division, floats, etc.)

You are no longer a “beginner experimenting.”
You are now **building complete programs with correct logic**.

This is MAJOR progress.

# 🚀 Ready for Next Project

Whenever you're ready, we move to the next project in your roadmap:

**Even-Odd Number Sorter**
or
**File Line Counter**
— your choice.

Just say: **next project**.
