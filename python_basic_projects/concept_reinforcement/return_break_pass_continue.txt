Absolutely 👍 — here’s your **complete, well-structured reference document** on
`return`, `break`, `continue`, and `pass` — written in clear English with examples and memory cues.

# 🧭 Python Control Flow — `return`, `break`, `continue`, and `pass`

These four keywords control **how and when** your program moves from one part of code to another.
They’re small, but mastering them gives you full control over your loops and functions.

---

## 🧩 1️⃣ `return`

### 🔹 Purpose

Ends a **function** immediately and optionally **sends a value back** to the caller.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

> “I’m done — here’s the result. Stop running this function now.”

### 🔹 Example

```python
def find_even(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return num  # exits the whole function
    return None  # runs only if loop finishes
```

**Output:**

```
find_even([3, 5, 6, 7]) → 6
```

✅ Exits the *entire function*, even if inside nested loops.

---

## 🧩 2️⃣ `break`

### 🔹 Purpose

Stops the **current loop** immediately and jumps **out of it**,
but the rest of the function still continues.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

> “Stop looping now, but stay in the function.”

### 🔹 Example

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
print("Loop ended.")
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
Loop ended.
```

✅ Only exits the current loop — not the entire function.

---

## 🧩 3️⃣ `continue`

### 🔹 Purpose

Skips the **rest of the current iteration** and moves to the **next loop iteration**.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

> “Skip this one — go to the next.”

### 🔹 Example

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue  # skip 2
    print(i)
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
3
4
```

✅ Loop continues, but the rest of code under `if i == 2:` is skipped for that turn.

---

## 🧩 4️⃣ `pass`

### 🔹 Purpose

Does **nothing** — used as a **placeholder** where Python expects a statement.
It allows your code to run syntactically even if you haven’t written logic yet.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

> “Do nothing here (for now).”

### 🔹 Example

```python
for i in range(3):
    if i == 1:
        pass  # do nothing, continue normally
    print(i)
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
```

✅ Keeps program valid even with an “empty” block.

## 🔍 Quick Comparison Table

| Keyword        | Scope    | What It Does                    | Stops Function? | Stops Loop?                |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| **`return`**   | Function | Ends function and sends a value | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes (if inside loop)     |
| **`break`**    | Loop     | Exits the loop entirely         | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes                      |
| **`continue`** | Loop     | Skips rest of current iteration | ❌ No            | ❌ No (only skips one turn) |
| **`pass`**     | Anywhere | Does nothing (placeholder)      | ❌ No            | ❌ No                       |

## 🧠 Memory Trick

| Keyword    | Mnemonic           | Meaning                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `return`   | 🏁 “End the story” | Exit the function completely                 |
| `break`    | 🛑 “Stop looping”  | Leave loop, continue after it                |
| `continue` | ⏭️ “Skip this one” | Go to next loop iteration                    |
| `pass`     | 😴 “Do nothing”    | Placeholder; continue as if nothing happened |

## 🧩 Combined Example — All Four in One Script

```python
def process_numbers(nums):
    for num in nums:
        if num < 0:
            print("Invalid number, skipping...")
            continue        # skip negatives
        elif num == 0:
            print("End signal received.")
            break           # stop loop entirely
        elif num == 5:
            pass            # do nothing special
        print("Processing:", num)
    return "Done processing"  # exit function

print(process_numbers([1, 2, -3, 5, 0, 8]))
```

**Output:**

```
Processing: 1
Processing: 2
Invalid number, skipping...
Processing: 5
End signal received.
Done processing
```

| You Want To...                     | Use        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Stop the whole function            | `return`   |
| Stop looping early                 | `break`    |
| Skip one item in the loop          | `continue` |
| Leave a placeholder or empty block | `pass`     |
