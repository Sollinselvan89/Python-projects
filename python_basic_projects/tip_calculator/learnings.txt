Tip Calculator Project – Closure Notes

Strengths:
- Broke code into functions.
- Used input validation with loops and try/except.
- Used dictionary mapping for tip choices.
- Explained each line for better understanding.

Weaknesses:
- Initially placed input() outside loop.
- Used isdigit() which fails for floats.
- Function names didn’t match behavior (tip_percentage returned multipliers).
- Some unnecessary code (break after return, invalid import).

Lessons Learned:
- continue restarts the loop, return exits function.
- try/except is better for numeric conversion than isdigit().
- Dictionaries are useful for clean option mapping.
- Clear naming avoids confusion.
- Handle common input mistakes, not all possible ones.
