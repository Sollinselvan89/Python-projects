Excellent work 👏 — your **Git Incremental Learning Plan** is structured perfectly.
Here’s a quick **progress audit + next-step roadmap** 👇

---

## ✅ What You’ve Already Completed

### 🟩 **Stage 1 — Core Commands**

You’ve done:

* `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m`, `git push`, `git log --oneline`
  ✅ **Fully covered and applied correctly** during your project.

---

### 🟩 **Stage 2 — Safe Experimentation (Branches)**

You’ve practiced:

* `git checkout -b feature/pytest-and-docs`
* `git merge`, `git branch -d`, `git push origin --delete`
  ✅ **Completed successfully**, including branch creation, merge, and cleanup.

---

### 🟨 **Stage 3 — Undo & Compare**

You’ve done part of this:

* ✅ `git diff` (used it correctly)
* 🚫 Haven’t yet practiced `git restore`, `git reset`, or `git checkout <commit_id>`
  ➡️ **Next short learning goal:** practice undoing commits safely in a sandbox repo.

---

### 🟨 **Stage 4 — Milestones & Tags**

You haven’t tried tagging yet.
Next step:

```bash
git tag v1.0 -m "Word/Character Counter - Stable Release"
git push origin v1.0
```

➡️ This marks your project as a **stable checkpoint** (like version 1.0).

---

### ⚪ **Stage 5 — Collaboration & Maintenance**

Not yet explored — you’ll learn this once you start syncing across devices or contributors:

* `git clone`, `git pull`, `git fetch`, and handling merge conflicts.

---

## 🧭 Recommended Next Git Skills

Once you’re confident with Stages 1–4:

1. **`git stash`** — temporarily save uncommitted changes.
2. **`git rebase`** — clean up commit history (advanced, later).
3. **`.gitignore`** — ignore files like `__pycache__/` and `.env`.
4. **Merge conflict resolution** — learn how to fix conflicts manually.

---

### 🎯 Your Current Git Level

**Intermediate beginner (Stage 2.5)**
You’ve mastered version tracking and branching — now ready to learn *undoing, tagging, and syncing*.

Would you like me to give you a short “Stage 3 Practice Script” — a safe way to practice `restore`, `reset`, and `checkout` without breaking your project?

Git Command Summary (Quick Reference)
Command	Purpose
git init	Start a new Git repository in the current folder
git status	Show changed, staged, and untracked files

✅ **Standard Git commit message format:**

```
<type>: <short, imperative description>
```

**Common types:**

* `feat:` → new feature
* `fix:` → bug fix
* `docs:` → documentation
* `refactor:` → code cleanup
* `test:` → test-related changes
* `chore:` → maintenance tasks

**Example:**

```
feat: add pytest for count_character function
fix: handle FileNotFoundError correctly
docs: update project summary
```
Sure ✅ — here’s the full command with proper format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add pytest for count_character function"
```

**Other examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "fix: correct typo in character_counter filename"
git commit -m "docs: add learning summary to README"
git commit -m "refactor: clean up variable names and comments"
```

👉 Always use **present tense, short, and clear** — like “add”, “fix”, “update”, not “added” or “fixed”.
