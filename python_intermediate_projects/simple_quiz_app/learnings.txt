Learnings From the Simple Quiz App Project
✔ 1. Working with Nested Data Structures

You learned how to store quiz questions using:

a list (multiple questions)

of dictionaries (question, options, answer)

containing a list inside each (options)

This strengthened your understanding of real-world data structures.

✔ 2. Typing With Union Types (|)

You understood:

why we use str | int

why values in the dictionary use str | list[str]

how to read union types properly

version requirements (Python 3.10+)

This improved your clean-code + type-hinting foundation.

✔ 3. Input Validation Loops

You implemented a clean while True validation:

ensuring only valid choices (a/b/c/d/q)

looping until valid input

handling quit option (q)

Improves user interaction reliability.

✔ 4. Function Return Logic Without Else

You learned how to correctly write:

return 1 (correct)

return 0 (wrong)

return "q" (quit)

And how to avoid the "correct and wrong both increase" mistake.

✔ 5. Separation of Logic Into Functions

ask_questions() handles one question

run_quiz() handles the loop, scoring, and final reporting

This increased your modular programming clarity.

✔ 6. PEP 8 Docstrings and Type Hints

You added:

module description

one-line docstrings for each function

proper type annotations

readable naming conventions

This strengthened your clean-code habits.
