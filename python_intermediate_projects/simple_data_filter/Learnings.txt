Here is a **professional, concise commit message** + **personalized learnings**, based entirely on your actual questions, mistakes, debugging, and corrections throughout this project.

# ✅ **Professional Commit Message**

**feat: complete CSV Data Filter Tool with numeric & string filtering modes**

* Implemented full CSV filtering workflow: file loading, column selection, filter mode selection, and filtered output generation.
* Added robust validation for file paths, headers, empty CSVs, numeric operators (`<=`, `>=`, `==`, `<`, `>`), and string inputs.
* Implemented operator parsing, numeric comparison logic, and case-insensitive string matching with exact and contains modes.
* Ensured consistent return types and added typing annotations for all functions.
* Added PEP 8–aligned docstrings, spacing, indentation, and line breaks.
* Included output CSV writer with UTF-8 encoding and proper header handling.
* Finalized project after debugging issues around iterator usage, return placement, KeyError avoidance, and incorrect CSV selection.

# 📘 **Learnings Based on *Your Own* Work and Mistakes**

### **1. CSV DictReader is an iterator, not stored data**

You learned that:

* `DictReader` does not store rows
* File closes after the `with` block
* You must use `list(reader)` *inside* the `with` to keep data

This fixed your “reader becomes useless” confusion.

---

### **2. Operator parsing must check two-character operators first**

You initially checked operators wrong (`in` instead of `startswith`) and misunderstood ordering.

Now you understand:

* `"<=20".startswith("<=")` → correct
* Slice using `len(operator)`
* Two-char ops must be checked before single-char ops

---

### **3. Empty string is different from None**

You asked about `[]` vs `None` — now you know:

* `[]` is a valid list
* `None` means no value
* Returning consistent types avoids unpacking errors

---

### **4. Return placement inside vs outside loops**

You deeply debugged `return` placement:

* `continue` restarts the loop
* `break` exits the loop
* `return` outside the loop runs only after valid input
* You understood loop flow completely

This was one of your biggest insights.

---

### **5. String filtering: exact vs contains**

You learned:

* `in` is NOT regex
* Use `value.lower() in text.lower()`
* `isdigit()` checks *all digits*, not mixed strings
* Use `any(char.isdigit() for char in text)` to block strings containing digits

---

### **6. KeyError happens when column names don’t match**

You fixed your own KeyError by validating:

* CSV header
* Empty rows
* Column choice
* Wrong CSV file (you accidentally opened your Python code file 🤣)

---

### **7. PEP 8 discipline**

You learned:

* 79-char line length
* Proper indentation
* Blank lines between functions
* Spacing around commas and operators
* Docstring placement
* How to break long strings/functions cleanly

Real professional formatting.

---

### **8. You used VS Code debugger like a real developer**

You learned:

* Breakpoints
* Stepping through logic
* Understanding loop flow
* Seeing variable states

This reduced your errors drastically.
